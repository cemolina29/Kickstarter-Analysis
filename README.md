# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to unconver trends. This project is a great way to learn and understand all the needed tools, skills and information that is available to you to be able to present an analysis and more information that is easier for others to understand and visually see. The project helps you understand and identify data trends,changes and results.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide more information and to give a better understanding of the data that was gather to find the outcomes of the crowdfunding campaing based on the date and the goals. The findinds will be presented using visual representation like graphs.

## Analysis and Challenges
To be able to determine if the kickstarter campaings would meet the goals in the time expected, there was two factors taken into account. 
- Outcomes based on Launch date
- Outcomes based on Goals


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The above graph represents the outccome based on launch date. Louis campaing fell short on her goal possibly due to the lauch date. We can see which are the best months and the worst for Louis to start a campaing. The best month was May being the most successful month. Then we can see June and July with a good number, still above 80.
Then we see that the month of December had the highest number of failed so it would not be recommended to launch during that month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The above graph represents the outcomes based on the goals. The goals that Louis presented were much higher than the average successful goal. We can see that the goals need to be re-evaluated to a more realistic goal that can be reached.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The month that the campaing was launched could not have been the best but with the information gather we now have a more realistic idea of the best time of when a campaing should be launched.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Presenting more realistic number based with more realistic information would be helpful to meet the goals and have a more successful outcome. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset is not big enough for all categories and subcategories to be statistically analyzed. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
